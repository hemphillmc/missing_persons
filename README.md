A small screen scraper to determine missing persons statistics in Alabama

It's tough to understand growing real world trends versus what the media is deciding to more heavily report.

One major example of this is missing persons cases in Alabama. There are constant reports, but 
does reporting actually reflect an underlying trend? How to discover those trends when the data 
isn't officially stored in a longitudinal database or is extremely messy? 

This notebook walks through ways to extract data from online sources, extract features from 
said data, and from those features, extract visualizations and insights. 

The theme is that as a data scientist, you have the means to ask and answer vital questions that impact
society. The notebook walks through the missing persons tool and provides some suggestions on 
packages to learn for exploratory analysis.
